**Added:**
* Added --expense-db flag to a_presentation adder. If specified, it adds 
  the expense item generated for the presentation to the specified database. 
  Without a specification, by default the helper attempts to use the first 
  database in the regolithrc.json file but will only do so if that database 
  is non-public.

* Added the --force option to the a_presentation adder. If specified, 
  presentation expense data will be added to the first DB listed in 
  'databases' in the regolithrc.json file, even if that database is public.
